# CSharpVendingMachine
This project was created for C# Practice. It will contain a local SQL database for data retention, as well as unit tests for functional validation. The program will simulate the use of a new vending machine. Customers will be able to purchase multiple items at a time. They will also be able to pay with cash/change/card. Stockers will be able to sign in with a passcode and update the inventory of the machine. Administrators will be able to create and modify stockers and other administrators as well as edit inventory. Purchase and maintenance history will be logged.
